P5.js Documentation

Overview

I really had no prior experience in coding or programming, and I came from an art background. My understanding of logic and math is minimal, but I was curious about how it could contribute to visual design. At the same time, I had contradictory feelings about it, because math doesn’t like me—or maybe logic doesn’t like me. Still, I wanted to see how something that feels so structured and rule-based could create something visual and expressive.

Day 1 — Basic Shapes and the Rasa of Courage

In the first class, we learned about the setup() and draw() functions and how they create the base structure of a p5.js sketch. We experimented with simple shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles, and learned how to apply color using the fill() function.

For our first assignment, we had to translate an emotion or rasa into an abstract composition using only geometric forms. I chose the rasa of Courage, which, for me, felt like sparks , small bursts of energy that grow and spread into something larger.

At first, I tried using triangles because I felt their sharpness could represent the boldness and intensity of courage. But soon I realized that plotting the coordinates of triangles was much harder than I expected. No matter how I adjusted them, the sparks didn’t look the way I imagined. So I tried again.

In my second iteration, I replaced the triangles with circles and rectangles. The circles represented the origin point, the moment of thought, of daring , and the rectangles stretched outward like streaks of energy. Together, they formed a sense of direction and movement, like courage spreading outwards from a single point.

The background was gray to represent mundanity. the ordinary world where courage stands out like a spark in dullness.

That was my first encounter with how coding could reflect emotion, not through direct representation, but through rhythm, form, and logic.

Day 2 — Variables, Interactivity, and Transition from Courage to Fear

On the second day, we learned about variables and interactivity, how to use mouseX and mouseY, and how changing values can make the visuals respond to actions like mouse movement or clicks. We also worked with conditionals like if and else, and I began to see how code could build small systems of cause and effect.

The assignment was to translate the previous emotion into its opposite. So I worked on transforming Courage into Fear. On a mouse click, all the bright sparks that represented courage disappeared, and sharp triangles appeared in their place. The circular glow dimmed into a low, faint orange , almost lifeless. The scene became quiet and tense, like the spark had been extinguished.

This project helped me understand how interactivity could be used to express emotional change. The challenge wasn’t just technical but conceptual — how to make a digital sketch feel something. Even though I’m still struggling with triangle coordinates (they have a personal vendetta against me).

Day 3 — Pattern Grid Exploration

On Day 3, we were introduced to preload() and loops, The assignment was to create a 50-pixel-based grid and draw anything we liked that could form a continuous pattern.

My first attempt was... chaotic, to say the least. The pattern refused to loop seamlessly and broke the moment it hit the edges of the grid. 
Initially, I tried making a cat and a fish, which looked adorable but didn’t quite connect. So, in my second attempt, I went abstract, cloud-like shapes that shifted between being cats, bats, or even stingrays depending on how you looked at them. It reminded me of how creativity often lives in ambiguity , not one form, but many interpretations at once.

I started watching The Coding Train videos to understand more.

Day 4 — The Spitesheets

Day 4 was the spreadsheet was fun but the kind of assignment that humbled me. The goal was to load a spreadsheet and assign keys to specific actions in p5.js. It sounded easy until i started to wrte the same code on my own . My  few tries were full of syntax errors and commas misplaced.


There’s a strange satisfaction in making logic move. I realized that coding feels less like strict math and more like choreography , it became intimidating it became.

  GAME POEM - Weekend Assignment: “Life LENS”

For the weekend assignment, I wanted to make something emotional. something like one small change can shift everything.

At first, I had no inspiration. my roomate inspired me. But during a late-night chat with my roommate, I told her, “Maybe you’re seeing it differently  you could see it in a positive light.” It inspired me. I wanted to make a piece that captures the difference between “I have to do this” and “I get to do this.”

The concept : a pair of spectacles  one lens shows dull, negative visuals, while the other shows soft, blooming positivity. When you click one lens, the world drains of color — when you click the other, flowers start to fall. Initially, I made small yellow blobs for the flowers, but I wasn’t happy with how lifeless they looked. I wanted the scene to feel warm, like gentle affirmations falling from the sky.

I used class and constructor to create objects like petals and raindrops, a concept that only clicked for me during class. It was eye-opening to realize how you could build a “bag” of objects define them once, and then let them multiply, interact, and exist together. I also referenced The Coding Train and chat gpt after mutiple attenps tiring efforts of making 7/8 flowers by push n pop.

Even though the project isn’t fully complete, I want to expand it , add weather changes, different emotional responses, and subtle affirmations that feel genuine rather than overly positive. The goal is to create something introspective  a little melancholy, a little magic , that reminds the player that perception is everything.
